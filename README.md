# ðŸ§  Autism Education Knowledge Graph & QA System

This repository contains the materials for the paper:  
**"Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieve-Augmented QA for Autism Education"**

## ðŸ“š Overview

This project focuses on **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) education** in children. We construct a domain-specific **knowledge graph (KG)** from extensive educational literature and evaluate its value in enhancing question answering (QA) through a **Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework.

### Key Contributions

- A hierarchical ontology tailored to ASD educational contexts.
- A high-quality knowledge graph built from 203 papers and 4 monographs.
- A benchmark QA dataset covering key dimensions of ASD education.
- Comparative evaluation of small language models with and without KG augmentation.
- A bilingual (English/Chinese) QA demo interface.

## ðŸ“˜ Methodology

### 1. Knowledge Graph Construction

- Source: 203 peer-reviewed articles and 4 authoritative books.
- Ontology: 12 main classes â€” `Guideline`, `Effect `, `Intervention`, `Learner`, `Instance`, `Symptom-Type`, `Challenge`, `Educator`, `Institution`, `Outcome-Measure`, `Related-Research`, `Autism-Education`.
- Tools: Used **LightRAG** for entity-first, relation-completion extraction.
- Post-processing:
  - Removed isolated nodes.
  - Filtered low-confidence or ambiguous entities.

**Final Graph:**  
- 3,997 high-quality entities  
- 3,539 semantic triples

### 2. QA Dataset

- No existing public datasets in this field.
- We used **GPT-4o** to generate diverse high-quality QA pairs based on curated literature.
- Questions cover practical and theoretical aspects: diagnosis, support strategies, inclusion, etc.

### 3. Evaluation Strategy

Evaluation is based on the following five weighted dimensions:

| Code | Dimension Name                    | Description                                                                                     | Weight |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| KC   | Knowledge Coverage                | Core concepts and topic relevance (e.g., diagnosis, intervention)                              | 30%    |
| PDA  | Professional Depth & Accuracy     | Use of terminology, scientific accuracy, literature grounding                                   | 35%    |
| PV   | Practical Value                   | Feasibility and relevance of suggestions in educational settings                                | 15%    |
| LS   | Logical Structure                 | Coherence, reasoning structure, alignment with question                                          | 10%    |
| LE   | Language Expression               | Serious expression issues affecting comprehension (minor readability drops allowed)            | 10%    |

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Results

We tested several small-scale models under consistent evaluation settings:

| Metric                             | DeepSeek-r1 (1.5B) | LLaMA3.2 (1B) | Qwen3 (0.6B) | Qwen3 (1.7B) |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Score without KG                  | 6.60               | 7.57          | 7.04         | 8.05         |
| Score with KG                     | 6.91               | 7.87          | 7.45         | 8.33         |
| Improved Proportion (%)           | 82.0%              | 81.6%         | **81.9%**    | 79.9%        |
| Average Score Gain                | 0.31               | 0.30          | **0.41**     | 0.28         |
| Avg. Relative Gain per QA (%)     | 4.82%              | **7.51%**     | 6.20%        | 3.64%        |
| Average Gain (â†‘ only)             | 0.46               | 0.45          | **0.55**     | 0.42         |
| Rel. Gain per QA (â†‘ only, %)      | 7.18%              | **10.36%**    | 8.19%        | 5.44%        |

> Models performed better across all metrics when using knowledge graph augmentation. Smaller models gained more.
